<p>R Markdown supports Python integration with the package <code>reticulate</code>.The nice thing about R Markdown is that it is the first scripting language I have ever learned. Therefore, I am almost too comfortable with it. It is my go to for most of my project because it’s so easy to get a proof of concept with new ideas. The downfall of it - until now - is that I was unaware that we could use PYTHON IN R MARKDOWN! Mind Blown! It sounds so easy too; duh, you could use Python in R Markdown this is 2018. But honestly, it has never crossed my mind to try… until now.</p>
<p>It is fairly easy to get started. Just install the package and run! Here is a list of all supported languages.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>names(knitr::knit_engines$get())</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;reticulate&quot;)
library(reticulate)</code></pre>
<p>You will need to use <code>&quot;``` {python} CODE CHUNK HERE ```&quot;</code> to get started.</p>
<p>If you would like to use Python 3, simply use terminal and type <code>which python</code> and paste that directory in <code>engine.path = '{PATH}'</code>.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import matplotlib
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
np.random.seed(19680801)
# example data
mu = 100  # mean of distribution
sigma = 15  # standard deviation of distribution
x = mu + sigma * np.random.randn(437)
num_bins = 50
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
# the histogram of the data
n, bins, patches = ax.hist(x, num_bins, density=1)
# add a &#39;best fit&#39; line
y = ((1 / (np.sqrt(2 * np.pi) * sigma)) *
     np.exp(-0.5 * (1 / sigma * (bins - mu))**2))
ax.plot(bins, y, &#39;--&#39;)
ax.set_xlabel(&#39;Smarts&#39;)
ax.set_ylabel(&#39;Probability density&#39;)
ax.set_title(r&#39;Histogram of IQ: $\mu=100$, $\sigma=15$&#39;)
# Tweak spacing to prevent clipping of ylabel
fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()</code></pre>
