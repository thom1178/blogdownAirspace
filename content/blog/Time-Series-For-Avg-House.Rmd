## Flex Dashboards

Everyone knows high-level languages are wonderful. The issues of yester-year are long gone; we no longer have to build dashboards from scratch. Being able to query data, and display directly thorugh R is here, and I don't see it going anywhere anytime soon. 

Flexdashboard is an open source package in R that allows users to display dashboards directly in browser. It also has publishing support through RStudio. Assuming you have moderate traffic (like me), it's perfect!

### Let's get started:

```{r}
#install.packages("flexdashboard")
require(flexdashboard)
```
