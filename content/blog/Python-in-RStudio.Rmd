## Python in R Markdown

R Markdown supports Python integration with the package `reticulate`; it is fairly easy to get started. Just install the package and run! Here is a list of all supported languages.

```{r eval = T }
names(knitr::knit_engines$get())

```

```{r eval = F }
install.packages("reticulate")

```

You will need to use `"``` {python} CODE CHUNK HERE ```" ` to get started.

```{python}

import sys
print(sys.version)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([6,8,10, 12, 21, 44,47, 50, 51])
plt.show()
```


### Go and create!
