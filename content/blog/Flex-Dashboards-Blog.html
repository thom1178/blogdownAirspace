<h2>Flex Dashboards:</h2>
<p>Everyone knows high-level languages are wonderful. The issues of yester-year are long gone; we no longer have to build dashboards from scratch. Being able to query data, and display directly thorugh R is here, and I don’t see it going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
<p>Flexdashboard is an open source package in R that allows users to display dashboards directly in browser. It also has publishing support through RStudio. Assuming you have moderate traffic (like me), it’s perfect!</p>
<p>You can take a look at the dashboard I build here: <a href="https://jamelt.com/flex-dashboard-example" class="uri">https://jamelt.com/flex-dashboard-example</a></p>
<div id="lets-get-started" class="section level3">
<h3>Let’s get started:</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>#install.packages(&quot;flexdashboard&quot;)
require(flexdashboard)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Loading required package: flexdashboard</code></pre>
<p>In order to build a Flexdashboard, you need start a new R Markdown document, and choose <code>From Template</code>.</p>

<p>Once you’ve done that, choose <code>flexdashboard</code>.</p>
<!-- ![](https://jamelt.com/images/flexdashboard-newfile.png | width=100) -->
<p><img src="https://jamelt.com/images/flexdashboard-newfile.png" width="100%"  /> <br/><br/> The resulting document will be a flexdashboard template. Within the header of the file, you can include all of the startup code, ie. loading packages, loading flatfiles etc…</p>
<p>Once you have the template, you can start adding interactive plots via plotly and leaflet! It’s fairly simple to get started, and makes your plot look a lot more professional!</p>
