## Where Am I from?

I began this blog in the summer of 2018, mostly because I needed a place to put all of the things I do for fun. What better way than to build your own webssite and put all that crap there?? I have come across this beautiful post from the D3js website. It creates a plot of where the author has been. I will recreate the same plot here, but with the leaflet package in R. 

```{r dataload}
require(leaflet) #package to 

cities <- read.csv("./")

```
