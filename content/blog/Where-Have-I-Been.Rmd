## Where Am I from?

I began this blog in the summer of 2018, mostly because I needed a place to put all of the things I do for fun. What better way than to build your own webssite and put all that crap there?? I have come across this beautiful post from the D3js website. It creates a plot of where the author has been. I will recreate the same plot here, but with the leaflet package in R. 


```{r dataload, echo = F, eval=T, results="hide"}
url <- "https://jamelt.com/data/cities-lived.csv"

```

```{r data}
require(leaflet) #packages
require(DT)

cities <- read.csv(url, header = T)
DT::datatable(cities)

```
