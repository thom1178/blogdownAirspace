      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>R Markdown This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.
You can embed an R code chunk like this:

      <description>Flex Dashboards Everyone knows high-level languages are wonderful. The issues of yester-year are long gone; we no longer have to build dashboards from scratch. Being able to query data, and display directly thorugh R is here, and I don’t see it going anywhere anytime soon.
Flexdashboard is an open source package in R that allows users to display dashboards directly in browser. It also has publishing support through RStudio. Assuming you have moderate traffic (like me), it’s perfect!</description>

      <description>Plotly for College Analysis In this post, we explore open college data. This dataset includes the name of the college, the aggregated number of people who passed a particular subject by transfer level and race.
Let’s read out data and take a look:
There is a wonderful package called DT that creates interactive plots in HTML. It even comes with a search feature.</description>

      <title>Python in R Markdown?</title>

      <description>Python in R Markdown R Markdown supports Python integration with the package reticulate.The nice thing about R Markdown is that it is the first scripting language I have ever learned. Therefore, I am almost too comfortable with it. It is my go to for most of my project because it’s so easy to get a proof of concept with new ideas. The downfall of it - until now - is that I was unaware that we could use PYTHON IN R MARKDOWN!</description>

      <description>SQL SQL is a querying language used to manipulate databases. On its own, it is a powerful tool in any Data Scientist’s toolbox. When you pair SQL with R (or Python), you have indespensible foundations to conduct even the basic analytics. This is not so much a lesson on SQL, but a lesson on connecting SQL with R via various packages. Moreover, we will use the packages dbplyr and dplyr to manipulate the datasets in a later blog.</description>

      <description>Where Am I from? I began this blog in the summer of 2018, mostly because I needed a place to put all of the things I do for fun. What better way than to build your own webssite and put all that crap there?? I have come across this beautiful post from the D3js website. It creates a plot of where the author has been.</description>
