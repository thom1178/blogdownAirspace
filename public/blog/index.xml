      <description>Plotly for College Analysis In this post, we explore open college data. This dataset includes the name of the college, the aggregated number of people who passed a particular subject by transfer level and race.
Let’s read out data and take a look:
There is a wonderful package called DT that creates interactive plots in HTML. It even comes with a search feature.</description>

      <description>Python in R Markdown R Markdown supports Python integration with the package reticulate.The nice thing about R Markdown is that it is the first scripting language I have ever learned. Therefore, I am almost too comfortable with it. It is my go to for most of my project because it’s so easy to get a proof of concept with new ideas. The downfall of it - until now - is that I was unaware that we could use PYTHON IN R MARKDOWN!</description>

      <description>SQL SQL is a querying language used to manipulate databases. On its own, it is a powerful tool in any Data Scientist’s toolbox. When you pair SQL with R (or Python), you have indespensible foundations to conduct even the basic analytics. This is not so much a lesson on SQL, but a lesson on connecting SQL with R via various packages. Moreover, we will use the packages dbplyr and dplyr to manipulate the datasets in a later blog.</description>

      <description>Where Am I from? I began this blog in the summer of 2018, mostly because I needed a place to put all of the things I do for fun. What better way than to build your own webssite and put all that crap there?? I have come across this beautiful post from the D3js website. It creates a plot of where the author has been.</description>
